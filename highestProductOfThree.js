/*
sorting doesn't work because we could mutliply negative numbers to make positive number
approach1: [brute force]
-use n^3 to generate all combinations and return the highest

approach 1:
-create all possible combinations and return the max

approach 2: Greedy solution
	- keep track of the lowest
	- keep track of the highest
	- keep track of the lowestProductOfTwo
	- keep track of the highestProductOfTwo
	- reevaluate the highestProductofThree


Goal: O(1) Space O(n) Time

HOW DO WE EMURATE THROUGH THIS HIGHEST PRODUCT OF 4? HIGHEST PRODUCT OF K?
[1, 10, -5, 1, -100, 2, 4, 6]

 proudctOfFour =  -50

 lowest = -5
 highest = 10
 highestTwo = ...
 lowestTwo = ...
 highestThree =  -50
 lowestThree = -50

How can we do this better?
KEY QUESTION:
1. What if we wanted the highest product of 4 items?
2. What if we wanted the highest product of k items?
3. If our highest product is really big, it could overflowâ†´ . How should we protect against this?
